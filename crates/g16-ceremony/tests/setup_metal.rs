//! `g16 setup --backend cpu` against `g16 setup --backend metal`, whole file, byte for byte.
//!
//! That comparison is the whole milestone. `tests/setup.rs` already pins the CPU path to
//! snarkjs' own bytes, so a Metal zkey equal to a CPU zkey is a Metal zkey equal to
//! snarkjs, and it is a `cmp` rather than a signature check: a verifying proof does not
//! notice a wrong point in section 8, and neither does `snarkjs zkey verify`, which
//! recomputes sections 3 to 7 but takes 8 and 9 on the transcript's word.
//!
//! Byte equality is not luck. Group addition is exact and associative, so the summation
//! order a backend picks cannot move the answer, and the exit is canonical affine. What a
//! `cmp` catches is the things that do move it: a mishandled point at infinity, a dropped
//! term, an `Fq2` miscompiled under register pressure.
//!
//! # Why this drives the binary instead of calling `setup()`
//!
//! `MetalMsmBackend` lives in `g16-metal`, which dev-depends on this crate to test its
//! kernels against `prepare::point_times_fr` and `CpuKeyScale`. Depending back on it, even
//! for a test, closes that loop. Driving `target/release/g16` costs a process spawn and
//! tests the thing the correctness bar actually names: the shipped command, its
//! `--backend` flag and its file output.
//!
//! So the binary has to exist. Build it first:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo build --release --features metal
//! cargo test --release -p g16-ceremony --test setup_metal -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Without it, or without the `metal` feature in it, every test here skips loudly rather
//! than reporting a green it did not earn. `G16_BIN` overrides the path.
//!
//! The four production circuits the density table in `setup::setup` is drawn from are not
//! in this repo, so they are opt in through `G16_ZEEVE_BUILDS`, pointed at the
//! `rebuild-2.2.3/builds` directory. They are the cases that matter most and the ones
//! nobody else can run: `--O2` is where three quarters of the terms reach the multiexp,
//! and it is the only place a Metal MSM does enough work to be wrong.
//!
//! The timings each case prints are a convenience, not a benchmark, and with
//! `G16_ZEEVE_BUILDS` set they need `--test-threads=1` to mean anything: cargo runs the two
//! tests concurrently, and a 2^20 setup against a 2^18 one is two twelve-thread runs and
//! several GB of resident ptau on one machine. `metal-profile/setup-metal-timings.md` holds
//! the numbers taken standalone.
